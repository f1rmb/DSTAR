#DSTAR Arduino header Encoding and decoding library#
F4GOH Anthony f4goh@orange.fr <br>

November 2015

Use this library freely with Arduino 1.6.5

## Installation ##
To use the DSTAR library:  
- Go to https://github.com/f4goh/DSTAR, click the [Download ZIP](https://github.com/f4goh/DSTAR/archive/master.zip) button and save the ZIP file to a convenient location on your PC.
- Uncompress the downloaded file.  This will result in a folder containing all the files for the library, that has a name that includes the branch name, usually DSTAR-master.
- Rename the folder to  DSTAR.
- Copy the renamed folder to the Arduino sketchbook\libraries folder.



## Usage notes ##


To use the DSTAR library, see /exemples/Radio_frame_header.ino.
